# A History of My Phones & Homescreens

I've always been a bit nerdy about my phone setup. From the early days of Android customisation to my current setup, here is a look back at the devices I've owned and how I liked to set them up.

### The Early Days
I got my first mobile phone when I went to secondary school. I had started travelling to school by myself for the first time and so my parents got me a basic phone to keep in touch with them. It was a Samsung E250 slidey phone. I still remember it well to this day, and it served my honourable, up until I lost it in a taxi in Hong Kong on the first day of a month-long family holiday.

- Sony ericsson not sure, need to check
- Huawei Ascend Y300 (with iPod touch 5th Generation, I carried both at all times in sixth form)
- LG G4, first proper top end smart phone, died due to boot looping issues
- Friend's iPhone 4s as replacement whilst I waited to buy a new one for myself
- Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Lost this when I fell asleep on the tube, whoops
- Pixel 3a XL
- Samsung Z Flip 3, screen broke twice, sold it
- Pixel 7
- Pixel 10 Pro, current phone
