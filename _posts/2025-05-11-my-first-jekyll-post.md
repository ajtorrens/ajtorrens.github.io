# Hello world, Jekyll style!

This is my first micro-post using Jekyll. It's pretty exciting.

I have always thought about hosting my own microblog. I don't want to make money, I just want to share some stuff that I find interesting.
I researched for the lowest barrier to entry to this world--ideally with the lowest cost--and settled on a combination of [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Amazingly, this is FREE to use, if you are happy to keep a generic URL reponame.github.io. However, I recently decided to purchase alextorrens.com (I definitely didn't need the .com domain but, eh, it's my name) and I linked the repo to my custom domain and BAM, here we are.
Expect to see this "static" blog website change a fair bit, as a slowly add content and learn how to make it prettier. Lots of tech I'm revisiting and/or learning from scratch:
- Git in the terminal and GitHub
- Jekyll (OSS project written in Ruby and the Gems ecosystem)
- Websites and domain names
- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- Who knows what else when I run into one of many technical issues!

Some of the topics I may want to write about include:
- Sport--both playing and watching
- Tech
- Food
- Cooking
- Photography
- Travel
- Science
And combinations thereof!
