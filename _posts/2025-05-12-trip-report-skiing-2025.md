Trip Report: Three Valleys Skiing

I love skiing. I am very lucky to have been a few times with my parents whilst growing up, which have led to me being relatively competent despite the fact I‚Äôm UK-based and ski for up to six days, once a year at most.
This trip was going to six of us lads heading to Les Trois Vallees (largest ski area in the world), where my friend Xav‚Äôs stepdad happens to have a chalet.
Trip Dates: 1-9 Feb 2025
Flight to Lyon was smooth. We picked up our hire cars and immediately started noticing heavier than usual traffic on the roads leading to the mountains. When we got to Albertville, to do The Big Shop, we started receiving snippets of information. There had been a rockfall on the one road leading up to the ski resorts with no diversion possible. One car had been hit, and there were now very large chunks taken out of the road surface. Cars were backed up on the motorway for dozens of kilometres. We decided to wait it out to start with, and see what new information came out. When nothing groundbreaking emerged, we eventually loaded up with more snacks and tried to drive through the night to see if we got anywhere. During the first three hours, we barely made it 1 km. It got to midnight, and again we‚Äôd not even managed to return to the main road to the mountains.
Whilst we were idling along with tens of thousands of others (it was holiday transition day too) the French authorities had worked miracles and set up a bi-directional system in the unaffected tunnel leading away from the mountain. This meant that some cars could trickle up and down from the resorts. But it was slow. Very slow. It was maybe 1am when we finally merged back onto the main road. We were taking shifts driving and sleeping. Having manual cars was not fun at all. But we were moving forward; I guess once the down-mountain traffic had calmed, they‚Äôd started letting traffic flow in both directions in the tunnel simultaneously. We were all taken by surprise when we eventually got to the tunnel, and through, and into the quiet sleeping town of Moutieres. We‚Äôd made it! We zoomed up the mountain, to the village of St Martin de Belleville. By the time I‚Äôd showered and got into bed, it was 6am.
At one point on that mad saturday, we‚Äôd all started to wonder that the trip may be over before it started. None of us would have put money on us skiing the next day. Sure, it was a short session, and definitely not worth the EUR 70, but we were skiing. The overpriced small beer on the mountain tasted extra good that afternoon.
Apart from this, the trip was pretty smooth. After Xav--who‚Äôs spent his entire life on skis--I was the next most experienced. When Xav went off to do a day of touring, I was in charge of planning a day on the slopes with the others, which went down well. I was skiing well, practicing different types of turns, a little off-piste here and there. Xav offered to take me to do a couple of his touring routes from earlier in the week, which scared me but also intrigued me. I‚Äôve never ski-toured before! Back to Sport 2000 Hire it was, to get all-mountain skis (a nice pair of atomic 95mm) and an avalanche pack.
The day was amazing. Hard, and exhausting, but wow. I feel like this is what skiing really should be. Hiking with the skis on my back was a different experience, but made the descent all the more satisfying. Did I mention I can‚Äôt really ski in deep powder? Lots of room for improvement on that. In normal alpine skiing, where the chairlifts do all the hard work, I‚Äôm never out of breath and rarely have a high HR. This was different though. Ski hiking is sweaty work, especially in all the layers. 
There was a very conveniently placed refuge for lunch, which even had a delicious vegan main (hard to come by in France üôÅ). We re-hydrated with beer and water, and then rejoined the piste to find the others.
No other big stories to tell‚Ä¶ fun evenings in the chalet, taking it in turns cooking, playing poker with wine corks as chips. We checked out the new post spa in the village. A glass of wine or two. Watched England beat France in the 6N. All good fun.
Our final day was Sunday 9 February, circled on my calendar as Super Bowl Sunday. This was going to be a 24 hour day. Here‚Äôs a summary of that Sunday:
5:30 (FR): Wake up to drive to Lyon Airport
11:30 (UK): Arrive At Gatwick
(unknown) Get the train to Calum‚Äôs in E&C, collect the rest of my stuff, get the tube to Euston, Catch the train to MK, get picked up by Alim and Xav (who‚Äôs driven from LGW), get to Xav‚Äôs, have dinner with his parents, and then wait for the SB to start. I survived just about to the end, which was at about 4am. How fun. And of course I was working the following day.
