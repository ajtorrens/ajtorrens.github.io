# Trip Report: Morocco

### Trip Dates: 23 February--09 March 2025
### Location: Taghazout, Morocco

I fancied some ~~winter~~ early spring sun, so back in November 2024 I found a cheap flight to Agadir and booked into [Sundesk](https://sun-desk.com/), a coliving space in Taghazout. Coliving is a relatively new concept which is a cross between a flatshare and a coworking space. The guests are usually digital nomads, freelancers, and remote workers.
Many people stay there for months at a time, getting away from the awful winter weather in central and northern Europe. I had two weeks there, which I tried my best to make the most of.
I can thoroughly recommend Sundesk. The staff, facilities and location are all top-notch. I stayed in two rooms during my two weeks; a twin for ten nights and a double to myself for the remainder (with a intermediate night in a separate hostel due to lack of availability).
Taghazout is known as a surfing village. There is a consistent beach break walkable from the village, which is where I went most days. I am very much still a beginner at surfing---not even standing up for the first couple of days---but after one week I was starting to get the hang of it and leave the comfort of the 'white waves' behind and head to the lineup. I think I got ~10 sessions of surfing in, some in the mornings before work and some for sunset, and I definitely improved. I even swapped in my soft foam board for a hard board for the last couple of days!

I was there over a middle weekend. With some fellow guests, we booked a taxi to Paradise Valley, a lush area for walking with some natural pools you could jump in. A few days later, I had the day off and I decided to try and cycle back there. Now, this was ambitious! I hired a gravel bike for the day, loaded up with food, water and tools, and set off. It was slow work; I was out of practice on the bike and the heat and hills made it hard work. I made it past Paradise Valley, and set off to attempt a loop back to Taghazout. I ended up bailing before a series of nasty hairpin turns that I knew I didn't have in me. I ended up finding an alternative route back along the river which was much easier. Lesson learnt!

It turned out to be quite a sporty trip. I ran, cycled and surfed a fair amount. This always happens when I travel, I always come back exhausted and needing more time off immediately.

There is a vegan spot in town, called Red Clay cafe. I ended up eating here and going for coffee a fair amount! Given Taghazout is a touristy surfing town, the vegan options were actually not bad for Morocco. I eat pretty well in my time there. I cooked a couple of times, having bought amazing produce from the local markets, but it was too tempting to go out most evenings with my newfound friends.

The second week of my visit coincided with the start of Ramadan. As a muslim country, it was interesting seeing how the locals observed this key pillar of islam. We were presented with iftar (dinner) on a couple of evenings, which was delicious. I tried to be respectful and not eat out in front of the locals. As a tourist town, it was easy to find food, but I did try to be considerate.

There were also only two places in Taghazout that served alcohol. Whilst I did visit both places, I did not drink much. I actually enjoyed the lack of alcohol, hardly thinking about it. The quality of the tea and cold drinks more than made up for it.

All in all, I had a great (and surprisingly productive) two weeks in Morocco. I improved my surfing, got work done, met some lovely people, and petted lots of cats. Flights are so cheap to Morocco, I may have to look at going back again in the future.
