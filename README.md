#Personal blog for Alex Torrens
I am experimenting with making my own personal website/blog to get some of my ideas/interests/lists and general nerdery out in to the open.
I am not promising that any of this will be useful to others, but it's a shame that some of this still is just sat in my cloud storage with no one else seeing it!

This will updated slowly as I learn about the relevant topics. To get to this stage, I've set up a custom domain (DNS is Squarespace), DNS management, git in the CLI and will be getting into full markdown to define and write articles.

Topics I want to cover:
- Interests
	- Sport
	- Tech
	- Science
	- Cooking
	- Travel
	- Photography (total noob getting started)

- List of topcis I may write about:
	- what's in my bag / daily carry
	- my tech / homescreens / apps / conventions
	- sports I'm interested in, kit, races, training
	- recipes, techniques, kit, 
	- recommendations for TV, films, music, apps, books
	- useful stuff from around the internet
	- what I use AI for (NOT writing!)
	- Life goals and progress
	- trip itineraries, packing lists and reports (my skydive?)
	- maybe photos/embedded vids as I learn about photograpgy
	- Nerdy lists (airports, countries, physics symbols lol)
	- Android vs apple ihones/macs

I am not planning on monetising this site anytime soon, I just want a place to put stuff that I don't mind people seeing. Most of my social media accounts are private so this will be a place for me to share more publically.
I am also learning useful tech/computer concepts to do this so it's going to be a good learning opportunity!

And, as always, thanks for reading.
