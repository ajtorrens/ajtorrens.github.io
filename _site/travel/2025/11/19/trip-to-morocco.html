<p>I fancied some ~winter~ early spring sun, so back in November 2024 I found a cheap flight to Agadir and booked into Sundesk, a coliving space in Taghazout. Coliving is a relatively new concept which is a cross between a flatshare and a coworking space. The guests are usually digital nomads, freelancers, and remote workers. 
Many people stay there for months at a time, getting away from the awful winter weather in central and northern Europe. I had two weeks there, which I tried my best to make the most of.
I can thoroughly recommend Sundesk. The staff, facilities and location are all top-notch. I stayed in two rooms during my two weeks; a twin for ten nights and a double to myself for the remainder (with a intermediate one-night stay in a separate hostel due to lack of availability).
Taghazout is known as a surfing village. There is a very consistent beach break walkable from the village, which is where I went most days. I am very much still a beginner at surfing—not even standing up for the first couple of days—but after one week I was starting to get the hang of it and leave the comfort of the ‘white waves’ behind and head to the lineup. I think I got ~10 sessions of surfing in, some in the mornings before work and some for sunset, and I definitely improved. I even swapped in my soft foam board for a hard board for the last couple of days!</p>
