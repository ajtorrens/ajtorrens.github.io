<p>I love skiing. I am very lucky to have been a few times with my parents whilst growing up, and most years since having a job, which have led to me being relatively competent despite the fact I’m UK-based and ski for–at most–six days a year.
This trip was going to six of us lads heading to <a href="https://www.les3vallees.com/en">Les Trois Vallées</a>–marketed as the largest connected ski area in the world–where my friend Xav’s stepdad happens to have a chalet. But calling this place a chalet was like calling Buckingham Palace a starter home. This place is ridiculous, with <strong>five</strong> ensuite rooms, modern kitchen, two garages, and a (communal) gym and two games rooms. Perhaps the most surprising thing about it is that it doesn’t have a hot tub!</p>
