<p>This is my first micro-post using Jekyll. It’s pretty exciting.</p>

<p>I have always thought about hosting my own microblog. I don’t want to make money, I just want to share some stuff that I find interesting.
I researched for the lowest barrier to entry to this world–ideally with the lowest cost–and settled on a combination of <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Amazingly, this is FREE to use, if you are happy to keep a generic URL reponame.github.io. However, I recently decided to purchase alextorrens.com (I definitely didn’t need the .com domain but, eh, it’s my name) and I linked the repo to my custom domain and BAM, here we are.
Expect to see this “static” blog website change a fair bit, as a slowly add content and learn how to make it prettier. Lots of tech I’m revisiting and/or learning from scratch:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Git in the terminal and GitHub</li>
  <li>Jekyll (OSS project written in Ruby and the Gems ecosystem)</li>
  <li>Websites and domain names</li>
  <li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a></li>
  <li>Who knows what else when I run into one of many technical issues!</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the topics I may want to write about include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sport–both playing and watching</li>
  <li>Tech</li>
  <li>Food</li>
  <li>Cooking</li>
  <li>Photography</li>
  <li>Travel</li>
  <li>Science
And combinations thereof!</li>
</ul>
