github_username: ajtorrens # Important for GitHub Pages
# For GitHub Pages, often it's good to specify the theme like this:
theme: minima # Minima is a clean, default Jekyll theme. We can change this later.

# If your site is at https://username.github.io/repository-name/
# then uncomment the following line and set it to /repository-name/
# baseurl: "/ajtorrens.github.io"

# If your site is at https://username.github.io/
# then baseurl should be "" or just commented out.

# To ensure GitHub Pages builds correctly, it's good practice to use the github-pages gem.
# We'll add this to the Gemfile next.
